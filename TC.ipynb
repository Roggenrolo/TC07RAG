      "Respuesta: ink helps drive democracy in asia the kyrgyz republic a small mountainous state of the former soviet republic is using invisible ink and ultraviolet readers in the countrys elections as part of a drive to prevent multiple voting.\n",
      " this new technology is causing both worries and guarded optimism among different sectors of the population.\n",
      " in an effort to live up to its reputation in the s as an island of democracy the kyrgyz president askar akaev pushed through the law requiring the use of ink during the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections.\n",
      " the us government agreed to fund all expenses associated with this decision.\n",
      " the kyrgyz republic is seen by many experts as backsliding from the high point it reached in the mids with a hastily pushed through referendum in reducing the legislative branch to one chamber with deputies.\n",
      " the use of ink is only one part of a general effort to show commitment towards more open elections the german embassy the soros foundation and the kyrgyz government have all contributed to purchase transparent ballot boxes.\n",
      " the actual technology behind the ink is not that complicated.\n",
      " the ink is sprayed on a persons left thumb.\n",
      " it dries and is not visible under normal light.\n",
      " however the presence of ultraviolet light of the kind used to verify money causes the ink to glow with a neon yellow light.\n",
      " at the entrance to each polling station one election official will scan voters fingers with uv lamp before allowing them to enter and every voter will have hisher left thumb sprayed with ink before receiving the ballot.\n",
      " if the ink shows under the uv light the voter will not be allowed to enter the polling station.\n",
      " likewise any voter who refuses to be inked will not receive the ballot.\n",
      " these elections are assuming even greater significance because of two large factors the upcoming parliamentary elections are a prelude to a potentially regime changing presidential election in the autumn as well as the echo of recent elections in other former soviet republics notably ukraine and georgia.\n",
      " the use of ink has been controversial especially among groups perceived to be progovernment.\n",
      " widely circulated articles compared the use of ink to the rural practice of marking sheep a still common metaphor in this primarily agricultural society.\n",
      " the author of one such article began a petition drive against the use of the ink.\n",
      " the greatest part of the opposition to ink has often been sheer ignorance.\n",
      " local newspapers have carried stories that the ink is harmful radioactive or even that the ultraviolet readers may cause health problems.\n",
      " others such as the aggressively middle of the road coalition of nongovernmental organizations have lauded the move as an important step forward.\n",
      " this type of ink has been used in many elections in the world in countries as varied as serbia south africa indonesia and turkey.\n",
      " the other common type of ink in elections is indelible visible ink but as the elections in afghanistan showed improper use of this type of ink can cause additional problems.\n",
      " the use of invisible ink is not without its own problems.\n",
      " in most elections numerous rumors have spread about it.\n",
      " in serbia for example both christian and islamic leaders assured their populations that its use was not contrary to religion.\n",
      " other rumours are associated with how to remove the ink various soft drinks solvents and cleaning products are put forward.\n",
      " however in reality the ink is very effective at getting under the cuticle of the thumb and difficult to wash off.\n",

      " often this help has come in the form of corporate art sponsorship or infrastructure provision.\n",
      " but that dance is growing more intimate as hitech firms look to the creative industries for inspiration.\n",

      " he looks after several centres of excellence which the telco has set up with other institutions and organisations one of which is focused on creative industries.\n",
      " to mark the initiatives launch a major international art installation is to open on april in brussels with a further exhibit in madrid later in the summer.\n",
      " they have both been created using the telcos technology that it has been incubating at its research and development arm including a sophisticated graphics rendering program.\n",
      " using a d graphics engine the type commonly used in gaming baftawinning artists langlands bell have created a virtual storybased d model of brussels coudenberg cellars.\n",
      " they have recently been excavated and are thought to be the remnants of coudenberg palace an historical seat of european power.\n",
      " the d world can be navigated using a joystick and offers an immersive experience of a landscape that historically had a river running through it until it was bricked up in the th century.\n",
      " the river was integral to the citys survival for hundreds of years and it was equally essential to the city that it disappeared said the artists.\n",
      " we hope that by uncovering the river we can greater understand the connections between the past and the present and appreciate the flow of modernity once concealing but now revealing the river senne.\n",
      " in their previous works they used the quake game graphics engine.\n",
      " the game engine is the core component of a video game because it handles graphics rendering game ai and how objects behave and relate to each other in a game.\n",
      " they are so timeconsuming and expensive to create the engines can be licensed out to handle other graphicsintensive games.\n",
      " bts own engine tara total abstract rendering architecture has been in development since and has been used to recreate virtual interactive models of buildings for planners.\n",
      " it was also used in in encounter an urbanbased pervasive game that combined both virtual play in conjunction with physical onthestreet action.\n",
      " because the artists wanted video and interactive elements in their worlds new features were added to tara in order to handle the complex data sets.\n",
      " but collaboration between art and digital technology is by no means new and many keen coders designers games makers and animators argue that what they create is art itself.\n",
      " as more tools for selfexpression are given to the person on the street enabling people to take photos with a phone and upload them to the web for instance creativity will become an integral part of technology.\n",
      " the orange expressionist exhibition last year for example displayed thousands of picture messages from people all over the uk to create an interactive installation.\n",
      " technology as a way of unleashing creativity has massive potential not least because it gives people something to do with their technology.\n",

      "Respuesta: digital guru floats sub pc nicholas negroponte chairman and founder of mits media labs says he is developing a laptop pc that will go on sale for less than .\n",
      " he told the bbc world service programme go digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries.\n",
      " he said one laptop per child could be very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family village and neighbourhood.\n",
      " he said the child could use the laptop like a text book.\n",
      " he described the device as a stripped down laptop which would run a linuxbased operating system we have to get the display down to below to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.\n",
      " the second trick is to get rid of the fat if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory.\n",
      " the device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down.\n",
      " mr negroponte said this was a not for profit venture though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money.\n",
      " in mr negroponte published the bestselling being digital now widely seen as predicting the digital age.\n",
      " the concept is based on experiments in the us state of maine where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.\n",
      " while the idea was popular amongst the children it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken.\n",
      " however mr negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops.\n",
      " we put in laptops three years ago only one has been broken the kids cherish these things its also a tv a telephone and a games machine not just a textbook.\n",
      " mr negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious.\n",
      " nokia make million cell phones a year so for us to claim were going to make million laptops is a big number but were not talking about doing it in three or five years were talking about months.\n",
      " he plans to be distributing them by the end of and is already in discussion with the chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order.\n",
      " in china they spend per child per year on textbooks.\n",
      " thats for five or six years so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education thats cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Introducción\n",
    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) es un enfoque de procesamiento de lenguaje natural que combina la recuperación de información y la generación de respuestas. Primero, busca fragmentos relevantes desde una base de datos usando embeddings y bases vectoriales como FAISS o Pinecone, y luego utiliza un modelo generativo (como GPT-3 o LLaMA) para crear respuestas contextuales basadas en esos fragmentos, permitiendo generar respuestas precisas y fundamentadas en un corpus específico.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objetivos:**\n",
    "* Sea capaz de responder preguntas basadas en un corpus de documentos.\n",
    "* Use el enfoque de Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) para combinar recuperación de información y generación de respuestas.\n",
    "* Una base de datos vectorial para almacenar y consultar embeddings del corpus.\n",
    "* Un modelo generativo para generar respuestas coherentes basadas en los fragmentos recuperados.\n",
    "* Provea respuestas relevantes incluso en un corpus amplio, demostrando la eficacia del enfoque RAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preparación del corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "**Carga del Dataset:**\n",
    "* Se cargaron los documentos, ya sea desdes archivos text en carpetas organizadas por categorías.\n",
    "* Cada artículo fue leído y almacenado como una entrada de texto.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limpieza del Texto:**\n",
    "* Se eliminaron caracteres especiales, números innecesarios y puntuación no esencial.\n",
    "* Todo el texto fue convertido a minúsculas para garantizar la uniformidad.\n",
    "* Se eliminaron espacios adicionales y se reemplazaron por un único espacio.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Segmentación:**\n",
    "* Los textos fueron divididos en fragmentos de 3 a 4 oraciones, lo que facilita el almacenamiento y recuperación de información en bases de datos vectoriales.\n",
    "* Esta segmentación asegura que cada fragmento sea lo suficientemente pequeño para ser manejado por modelos generativos.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generación de Embeddings\n",
    "La generación de embeddings se realiza utilizando Pinecone y un modelo preentrenado llamado multilingual-e5-large, diseñado para generar representaciones vectoriales de textos en múltiples idiomas. Este proceso transforma cada párrafo en un vector numérico de alta dimensionalidad (1024 dimensiones en este caso), que captura las características semánticas del texto.\n",
    "\n",
    "Los textos de los artículos son preprocesados y organizados en una lista plana, donde cada párrafo se identifica mediante un ID único (id) y se asocia con su contenido (text). Este preprocesamiento asegura que cada párrafo pueda ser identificado y recuperado fácilmente después de que se generen los embeddings. Se utiliza la API de Pinecone para realizar la inferencia con el modelo multilingual-e5-large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cada párrafo es convertido en un vector de 1024 dimensiones. Estos embeddings representan las relaciones semánticas del texto, lo que significa que textos similares tendrán vectores cercanos en el espacio vectorial. Los embeddings generados se devuelven como una lista, donde cada vector corresponde al párrafo en la misma posición de la lista de entrada.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diseño e implementación del flujo RAG\n",
    "Se solicita al usuario la consulta, se transforma en embedding, se hace la solicitud a la base de datos a partir de los embeddings generados de los artículos extraídos previamente. Se obtiene el artículo que más similitudes presenta con la consulta hecha.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pruebas y resultados\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Ejemplos de consultas\n",
    "[\n",
    "\"What helps drive democracy in Asia?\",\n",
    "\"What happened to China net cafe culture?\",\n",
    "\"What is Microsoft seeking?\",\n",
    "\"What gets the creative bug?\",\n",
    "\"Who is Nicholas Negroponte?\"\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Funciona mejor con preguntas que puedan ser sacadas directamente de los artículos y tiene un rendimiento menor con textos diferentes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusión\n",
    "Los chatbots RAG combinan técnicas de recuperación de información y generación de texto, lo que permite generar respuestas más precisas y contextualmente relevantes. Esto es especialmente útil cuando se interactúa con datos complejos o fuentes de información vastas. Utilizar datos de la BBC organizados en carpetas por temas te permitirá estructurar el contenido de manera eficiente, lo cual es crucial para una recuperación de información más precisa. Los archivos de texto dentro de cada carpeta representan documentos que contienen información relevante que el chatbot podrá usar para generar respuestas contextuales según la consulta del usuario. Pinecone es una plataforma especializada en el manejo de vectores de alta dimensión, lo que es perfecto para trabajar con modelos de lenguaje que generan embeddings (representaciones numéricas) de texto. Al utilizar Pinecone, puedes indexar los documentos de texto de la BBC (por tema) y convertir esos archivos en vectores que puedan ser recuperados de manera eficiente mediante consultas. El uso de datos organizados por temas de la BBC junto con Pinecone para almacenar y recuperar vectores es una combinación poderosa para desarrollar un chatbot RAG eficiente. Este enfoque no solo mejora la relevancia y precisión de las respuestas generadas, sino que también permite un sistema escalable, rápido y flexible. Sin embargo, es fundamental prestar atención a la calidad de los datos, la optimización del sistema de recuperación y la mejora continua para asegurar que el chatbot proporcione respuestas confiables y contextualmente apropiadas."
